suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the date conversion is specific to the date format in the dataset. A more robust approach would use the `strftime` function to handle different date formats or consider using a dedicated date parsing function if available.
- In Exercise 5, to find maximum employees per month use LIMIT clause with the order by in descending order instead of TOP (1)
- Exercise 5, the dataset does not have year, be sure to extract the year before doing the calculation
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code mostly addresses the exercises accurately. Exercise 1 correctly creates a temporary table and joins the tables, but the date conversion is specific to the format in the dataset. Exercises 2, 3 and 4 are correctly implemented. Exercise 5, has issue with extracting maximum employees throughout all the months.
- readability: The code is generally readable. The SQL queries are well-formatted and easy to understand. However, adding comments to explain the purpose of each step would further improve readability.
- performance: The queries are reasonably performant for the given dataset size. However, for larger datasets, consider adding indexes to the columns used in JOIN and WHERE clauses to improve query performance.
- security: The code itself doesn't directly introduce security vulnerabilities. However, when using this code in a real-world application, ensure that proper input validation and sanitization are performed to prevent SQL injection attacks. Also, avoid storing sensitive information directly in the database.
