suggestions for improvement:
- The response includes a mix of a beetle length calculation and property sales data, making it unclear which exercise it's trying to address.
- The 'beetle' section needs to clearly indicate the Excel formulas used for the calculations. Including the results without the formulas is not helpful.
- The file upload is missing so it is hard to verify results and understand data structures.
- The data has to be organized by headers and columns for each exercise.
- The second section of the response (the sales data) does not appear to be directly related to any of the exercises, resulting in a lower overall correctness score.
