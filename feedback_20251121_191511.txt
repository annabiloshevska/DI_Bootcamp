suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more robust error handling, such as handling file not found exceptions.
- For performance with very large word lists, consider pre-calculating sorted word signatures during initialization instead of repeatedly sorting in `is_anagram`.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding docstrings to the class and methods to improve readability.
- The conditional logic in `is_valid_word` and `is_anagram` can be simplified by directly returning the boolean expression.
- The original file path was absolute and hardcoded, consider using relative paths to enhance portability
