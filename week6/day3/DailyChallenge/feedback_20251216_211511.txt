suggestions for improvement:
- The code only implements part II of the exercise. Part I is missing completely. The submission focuses on creating tables and relationships for books, students, and a library, which aligns with the second part of the provided instructions, but fails to address the first part regarding Customers and Customer Profiles.
- In the library table creation, you included borrowed_date as part of the primary key. This might not be necessary if a student can borrow the same book multiple times on different dates. Consider if that's the desired behavior.
- Consider adding indexes on foreign key columns in the library table for improved query performance.
