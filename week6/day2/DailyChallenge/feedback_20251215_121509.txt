Brief justification:
- correctness: The code provides the correct SQL queries as described in the problem. It sets up the tables with data and then answers the four questions using SELECT COUNT(*) queries with NOT IN clauses. The explanations for each query's output are also accurate.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to read. The SQL queries are clear and concise.
- performance: The SQL queries are straightforward and should perform well on the given data.
- security: There are no apparent security concerns in this code as it primarily involves data selection and counting.
