suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `sing` method in Bengal class should accept `sounds` as the parameter, not `name` and `sounds`.
- In Exercise 1, you don't have to define `__init__` in the `Bengal` and `Chartreux` classes if you only use `super().__init__(name, age)` there.
- In Exercise 1, you should implement the jump method in the Siamese class.
- In Exercise 4, inside the Person class's init method, the line 'last_name = ("")' does not assign the empty string to the instance's last_name attribute. It instead defines a local variable that shadows the attribute, you should remove this line.
- Exercise 3 is missing.
