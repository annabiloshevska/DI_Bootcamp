suggestions for improvement:
- Implement the `__str__` method as specified in Step 5 of the instructions.
- The go_to_page method should return self to support method chaining, matching the other navigation methods and the instructions.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements the `Pagination` class with its initialization, `get_visible_items`, and navigation methods (`go_to_page`, `first_page`, `last_page`, `next_page`, `previous_page`).  It also correctly handles the `ValueError` for out-of-range page numbers. The only missing functionality is the `__str__` method. It does however implement the bonus requirement of method chaining. The prompt also gives instructions for testing the code and those instructions are implemented in the code itself.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand.  Variable names are descriptive, and the code is properly commented, making it easy to follow the logic.
- performance: The code uses efficient slicing for `get_visible_items` and simple arithmetic operations for navigation, resulting in good performance.
- security: There are no obvious security vulnerabilities in this code.
