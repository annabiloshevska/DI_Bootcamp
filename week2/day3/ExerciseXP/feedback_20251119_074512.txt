suggestions for improvement:
- For Exercise 2, it would be beneficial to include the content of `func.py` to ensure the solution is complete and self-contained for review.
- In Exercise 5, consider making the target year dynamic (e.g., always targeting January 1st of the *next* year) rather than hardcoding '2026'.
- In Exercise 6, handling potential `ValueError` exceptions from invalid date inputs would improve robustness.
