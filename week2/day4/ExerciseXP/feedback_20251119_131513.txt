suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more robust error handling for file operations in `get_words_from_file`, such as handling `FileNotFoundError`.
- The input validation in `main` could be simplified by directly checking if the input is an integer before casting, to prevent `ValueError` if the user enters non-numeric input.
- Instead of using `not in range(2, 21)` consider using `if sent_length < 2 or sent_length > 20:`
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the instructions for both Exercise 1 (Random Sentence Generator) and Exercise 2 (Working with JSON) as described in the chapter content. It correctly reads from a file, generates random sentences, parses JSON, modifies it, and saves it to a file. It also includes proper input validation as requested. The code directly addresses and fulfills all requirements outlined in the prompt.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear function definitions and comments explaining the purpose of each step. Variable names are descriptive. However, adding a few more comments to explain complex logic would improve readability further.
- performance: The code has good performance for the given tasks. The random sentence generation is efficient, and JSON parsing/serialization is handled appropriately. There are no obvious performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code has no immediate security concerns. Using `os.path.join` to construct file paths is a good practice to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. Input validation helps prevent unexpected behavior. However, consider sanitizing the word list if the source is untrusted.
