suggestions for improvement:
- In `get_info`, the formatting of the output does not exactly match the desired format in the example. Specifically, the spacing and alignment are off.
- The name attribute in the init was changed to farm_name which is not what the instructions asked for.
- The E-I-E-I-0! phrase needs to be on a separate line with indentation.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements the `Farm` class, `__init__`, `add_animal`, and `get_info` methods as described in the prompt. It initializes the `Farm` object, adds animals with their counts, and generates a string with farm information. The output is mostly correct but has formatting issues (alignment, spacing). The name attribute was also changed to farm_name which does not match with the instructions.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Variable names are descriptive. Comments are helpful. There could be more comments describing the logic.
- performance: The code has good performance, using a dictionary for storing animals, which allows for quick lookups and updates.
- security: The code doesn't have any apparent security vulnerabilities.
