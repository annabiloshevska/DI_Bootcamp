suggestions for improvement:
- Exercise 2: `favoirite_book` is misspelled. The function definition needs to be corrected to `favorite_book`.
- Exercise 3: The function `describe_city` is defined but only includes a return statement. It needs to actually print the described city and country.
- Exercise 4: The input from the user is not converted to an integer for comparison. This can lead to incorrect comparisons or errors. You should cast the input to an int using `int(input('Your number:'))`. Also the random number generator is outside the loop.
- Exercise 5: In the make_shirt function, the dot after the size in the printed message is incorrect. The message should include a space after the size and before the text. I have a syntax error when I add the space
- Exercise 6: The lists need to be shown for the function to work. Also the great magician should not be showing the first time
- Exercise 7: Your code works. Great
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code is mostly correct, addressing the core requirements of most exercises. However, Exercise 3's function doesn't print anything, and Exercise 4 does not convert the user input to an integer or has error handling. Exercise 2 also has a typo and exercise 5 has an error with the string concatenation
- readability: The code is generally readable, with clear function names and comments. However, some formatting inconsistencies and the typo in Exercise 2 affect readability.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the scale of the exercises. There are no significant performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code doesn't directly deal with user input in a way that poses security risks, but Exercise 4 should implement some form of error handling and validation of the user input.
