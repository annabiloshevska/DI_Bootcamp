suggestions for improvement:
- Ensure that the show_menu function handles the case where the menu is empty, printing "The menu is empty." as specified in the instructions.
- Validate that the price entered by the user in add_item and update_price is a valid float. Use a try-except block to handle potential ValueError if the input cannot be converted to a float.
- In add_item, the price should be converted to a float before storing it in the menu. Currently, it's being stored as a string. Ensure this conversion happens.
- In update_price, convert new_price to float before updating the menu.
- Consider adding input validation to prevent potential script injection.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements most of the required functionality, including showing the menu, adding items, updating prices, and deleting items. The main loop and option selection work as expected. However, it does not explicitly check for an empty menu in `show_menu`, and stores price as strings and not as floats, reducing the correctness score.
- readability: The code is generally readable with good function names and clear logic. Minor improvements can be made in formatting and commenting.
- performance: The performance is adequate for the given task. No significant performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- security: The code is vulnerable to script injection in the input prompts, as it does not validate input. Type conversion errors are also not handled.
