suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 2, the conditional logic for ages 1-3 is incorrect. The requirement stated that tickets are free for those under 3 years old. Your code includes 1, 2, and 3, but not 0.
- Consider adding a user input section in Exercise 2 for the bonus requirement to enhance code completeness.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly addresses the topics covered in the chapter content, including dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and nested data structures. All the exercises were addressed and fulfilled the requirements except the first if conditional statement in Exercise 2. The first if statement considered the numbers 1, 2, and 3 when it only needed to consider numbers less than 3.
- readability: The code is generally well-formatted and easy to understand, with clear variable names and comments explaining each step.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs calculations and dictionary operations in a timely manner.
- security: There are no security concerns identified in this code.
